### Special contributions
Special thanks to Ben Watts for his work in creating the splash screen and icon for this application.

Lastly many thanks go to Brent Aureli who provided an amazingly thorough tutorial on youtube showing how to make the classic
platformer [Super Mario Bro's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8MPxzkwBwo&list=PLZm85UZQLd2SXQzsF-a0-pPF6IWDDdrXt), which is
what I used as a template and starting point for this project. So go check out his channel!
