# Mongos
by Tom Drapes
## Android game
### LibGDX and Box2d

This is my first personal project that I made after my first year of studying computer science. It helped me better grasp the 
concepts behind object oriented programming with Java, as well as the process of deploying an app on the google play store.

Mongos was built using the libGDX framework and box2d physics engine.

## How to run

* Then make sure you select the DesktopLauncher as the Main Class. Also ensure that you have provided your current working
directory and set the classpath of module to desktop, then hit apply.

* Finally if the dropdown menu shows that desktop mode is selected you can simply press the green play button to run the
application.
